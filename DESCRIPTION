Title: Rainfall Frequency (Design Storm) Estimates from the US National
        Weather Service
Description: Estimates of rainfall at desired frequency (e.g., 1% annual
    chance or 100-year return period) and desired duration (e.g.,
    24-hour duration) are often required in the design of dams and other
    hydraulic structures, catastrophe risk modeling, environmental
    planning and management. One major source of such estimates for the
    USA is the NOAA National Weather Service's (NWS) division of
    Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center (HDSC). Raw data from
    NWS-HDSC is available at 1-km resolution and comes as a huge number
    of GIS files. This package provides functionality to easily access
    and analyze the 1-km GIS files provided by NWS' PF Data Server for
    the entire USA. This package also comes with datasets on record point
    rainfall measurements provided by NWS-HDSC.
