Version 0.2, Oct 2014
-----------

* NWS' website (ftp site) sometimes has connectivity issues. Website is checked for a response, and function proceeds only if it does.

* Package vignette changed to a Rmarkdown document.

* License changed from GPL to MIT

* The three tasks mentioned in v0.1 NEWS still remain to be addressed.

Version 0.1, May 2014
-----------

* `extract_freq` regional selection criterion does not include US territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam. Future updates would incorporate these regions. 

*  `rainfreq` currently does not extract the upper and lower limits of the confidence intervals on frequency estimates. Future updates would incorporate this data.
 
*  Data for Texas and Pacific Northwest is currently not available from NWS. When such data becomes available, `rainfreq` would be updated accordingly.
